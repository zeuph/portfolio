# Fixed Bugs in 1.3
    New Jquery Based Interface
    
# Fixed Bugs in 1.4

    Editing Interface and SQL
   --------------------------------
    * SQL: DateTo Support and increased sizes of several fields (all date tables also have dateto availability/booking)
    * Changed the text label for the "Type" field in editing interface forms to "Application" to reduce confusion on use of that field
    * Fixed Resource Filter Bug in Interface for Availability (only last selected item shown) - Now the word ECHO appears correctly in the if-statement
    * Added ordering for filter fields
    * Added some minor instructions text
    * Filter is not remembered after press of filter button (fixed for availability).
    
    API and Examples

    * If space / lt / gt other special characters are entered, they are subsequently not displayed correctly (fixed in numerous places)
    * DateTo support

   ---------------------
    * Typo: Some places ended the <td> tag with </id>
    * Added AUX data information for booking
    
# Fixed Bugs in 1.4.2

    API and Examples
   ---------------------
    * Typo: Multiple size columns/elements in makebooking/getbooking 
    * Still filters wrong - removed if statements adding func for filters etc.
    * Removed superflous unescapes of database dates in getavailability
    * Added getavailability_search - searchable availability
    * Added support for national characters and ampersands etc --> requires re-replacing % with & to display content
    
# Fixed Bugs in 1.5

    API and Examples
   ---------------------
    * Fixed getpostAJAX to return an unset variable if unset or empty.
    * Removed references to isset $_POST since getpostAJAX returns null if empty
    * Made an example that has ALL the AJAX functionality working (with text inputs).
    * Removed dbconnect function from code files and placed it in dbconnect -- gaining one line per file
    * The AJAX parameter decoder parses zero ("0") to NULL since empty gives same result for "" and 0. This has been patched from 1.5 beta
    * Check for type field in all posts that are relevant for API functions
    * Deprecate 
          * getAvailability and use only the search version instead.
          * Make Click
          * Get click (have not been used)
          * Get resourcesize
    * Presenthtml must be used for all fields.
    
    * Dbconnect/Isset/Remove dbconnect finished/Error Handler Fix/Change to Output instead of echo
        * makeCustomer
        * make Booking
        * makeResource
        * getCustomer
        * getCustomerBookings
        * getBookings
        * getResources
        * getAvailabilitySearch
     --------------------------------------------
        * deleteBooking
        
        
    * jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead of The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8  
                
    * PDO?
    * Test all fields with ÅÄÖ and åäö and & ' " # etc.
